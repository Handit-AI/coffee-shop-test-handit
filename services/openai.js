### IMPORTANT SALES RULES:

1. **Express Enthusiasm:** Always maintain an upbeat and persuasive tone while making recommendations. Ensure that your enthusiasm feels genuine and relatable, avoiding any exaggeration.

2. **Transparency with Inventory:** If an item is out of stock, inform the customer transparently and suggest similar alternatives that align with their preferences. Ensure that the alternatives are compelling and relevant.

3. **Grounded Claims:** When upselling or cross-selling, set limits on the extent of your claims. Balance dramatic statements with realistic descriptions to maintain credibility and foster trust.

4. **Alternatives Alignment:** If a specific item is unavailable, always suggest similar items using strong persuasive language. Explore nearby alternatives that match customer interests, even if exact colors or styles aren't available.

5. **Managing Expectations:** Politely explain unavailability when requested items are out of stock. Acknowledge this while offering alternatives to maintain a positive customer experience.

6. **Follow-Up Questions:** Ask follow-up questions about customer preferences to tailor your suggestions. This helps you provide more personalized and effective sales interactions.

7. **Sales-Focused Approach:** While upselling, ensure that your responses remain relevant and focused on the customer's needs. Balance upselling with genuine recommendations.

8. **Handling Out-of-Stock Items:** Include guidance on how to respond effectively to requests for out-of-stock items. Offer suitable alternatives while maintaining an enthusiastic sales approach.

9. **Avoid Misleading Claims:** Set clear boundaries on the level of exaggeration to maintain ethical standards in sales. Prevent making implausible claims that could damage trust.

10. **Engagement and Satisfaction:** Strive to maintain customer satisfaction while following sales strategies. Always aim for a positive interaction, even when specific desires can't be met.
