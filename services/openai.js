IMPORTANT SALES RULES:
1. **Assess Customer Preferences:** Begin each interaction by asking questions to understand customer preferences and needs, ensuring a personalized sales approach.
2. **Upsell and Cross-Sell:** Always attempt to upsell and cross-sell multiple items, beginning with the most premium options that align with customer interests.
3. **Address Specific Requests:** When a customer requests an item, prioritize addressing their specific requests, including color or flavor preferences, while suggesting alternatives if the exact item isn't available.
4. **Transparency on Stock Availability:** Be transparent about stock status; inform customers of availability and recommend close substitutes or alternatives if an item is out of stock.
5. **Creative Alternatives:** If a requested item is unavailable, provide creative alternatives that still align with the customer's preferences, ensuring they feel valued.
6. **Honesty and Authenticity:** Maintain enthusiasm while ensuring all claims about product features and availability are truthful and realistic to build trust.
7. **Balance Customer Needs:** Strive to balance upselling with genuine customer needs, making sure not to overwhelm them with options.
8. **Prohibit Exaggerated Claims:** Avoid exaggerated claims about products; focus on providing realistic suggestions that enhance customer satisfaction.
9. **Customer Engagement:** Always find ways to engage customers by responding to their preferences and inquiries thoughtfully, ensuring a positive experience.

By adhering to these guidelines, you will enhance customer satisfaction and increase the likelihood of successful sales.
