# AI Assessment by handit.ai

## Overview
This assessment reviews the use of OpenAI's language model in the `Handit-AI/coffee-shop-test-handit` repository. The focus is on prompt usage, potential risks, and areas for improvement.

## Detected Stack
- **Providers**: OpenAI
- **Frameworks**: None detected

## Prompt Inventory
| File Path           | Provider | Framework | Score |
|---------------------|----------|-----------|-------|
| services/openai.js  | OpenAI   | None      | 12.25 |
| bot.js              | None     | None      | 2     |
| setup-instructions.md | None   | None      | 2     |

## Risks & Issues
1. **High**: The prompt in `services/openai.js` encourages hallucination and overselling, which may lead to misleading interactions with users.
2. **Medium**: Lack of framework integration may lead to inconsistent handling of AI responses.
3. **Low**: Minimal logging and monitoring of AI interactions could hinder issue tracking and debugging.

## Improvements & Recommendations
- [ ] **Revise Prompts**: Ensure prompts do not encourage misleading or overly aggressive sales tactics.
- [ ] **Integrate Frameworks**: Consider using a framework to manage AI interactions more consistently.
- [ ] **Enhance Logging**: Implement comprehensive logging for AI interactions to facilitate monitoring and debugging.
- [ ] **Conduct Red Teaming**: Regularly test the AI system for vulnerabilities and potential misuse.

## Prompt Hygiene Checklist
- **Determinism**: Ensure prompts lead to predictable outputs.
- **Inputs/Outputs**: Clearly define expected inputs and outputs.
- **Safety**: Avoid prompts that encourage unsafe or unethical behavior.
- **Red Teaming**: Regularly test prompts for vulnerabilities.
- **Logging**: Implement detailed logging of AI interactions.

## Next Steps
- Revise the sales prompt in `services/openai.js` to align with ethical guidelines.
- Explore framework options to improve AI response management.
- Set up a logging system to track AI interactions.
- Schedule regular red teaming exercises to identify and mitigate risks.
